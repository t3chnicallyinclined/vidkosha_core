# Specialist Marketplace (Stub)

This is a placeholder so contributors know a marketplace concept exists. Economics (token, pricing, payouts, staking/slashing, fee splits), contracts, and governance details are intentionally omitted here.

## Scope
- No token names, prices, rewards, or slashing rules here.
- No escrow, fee splits, or contract flows here.
- No ranking, reputation weights, or payout math here.

## What to share
- Acknowledge the idea: operators may someday offer specialist services and earn for high-quality responses.
- Keep the repo focused on the `ckb_*_lite` workstreams and app/orchestrator features.
- Use testnets/fixtures only; keep chain code behind flags.

## How to contribute
- Improve the lite workstreams, Helix-backed UX, and operator bootstrap/testing tools.
- If you have marketplace ideas, open an issue so we can decide what to add here.

Teams can replace this stub with their economics pack during deployment.
