# Helix Schema (Stub)

This repo intentionally omits detailed memory/store schemas and ops runbooks.

- Contributors should not assume any specific database, schema, or query surface.
- If a change needs storage considerations, open an issue and we will decide what to expose.
- Keep contributions backend-agnostic and avoid adding provider-specific details.

For high-level work, focus on the `*_lite` workstreams and the backlog. When deeper schema context is needed, we'll add narrow notes per change.
