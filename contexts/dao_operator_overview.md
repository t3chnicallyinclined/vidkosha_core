# Vidkosha Cortex – DAO & Operator Overview (Non-Binding)

This is a non-final, non-binding overview meant to excite contributors and prospective node operators. Details (token, legal wrapper, emissions, settlement mechanics) are subject to change by the community and applicable law.

## Ownership & Change Safety Rails
- **Owner:** `ChainOpsAgent` curates; `CTOAgent` and `OpsCostAgent` review for architecture and cost impacts.
- **Update when:** roadmap, operator value prop, or decentralization plan changes.
- **Non-binding:** Everything here is directional only; parameters, jurisdictions, and mechanics can change.

## Why Run a Vidkosha Cortex Node
- Earn from real AI work: inference, routing, eval, data, and workflows that users and teams pay for.
- Win on quality: higher-quality outputs and reliability are routed more traffic.
- Join early: influence how routing, rewards, and governance solidify.
- Composable stack: Rust orchestrator + Helix AI Fabric; plug in models, tools, and storage.

## Network-at-a-Glance
- **Product:** A “ChatGPT++ for teams” front-end that sells outcomes (research, code, strategy) in familiar fiat/USDT billing.
- **Runtime:** Rust orchestrator + Helix for memory, routing, and eval; today it is off-chain and centralized for speed and safety.
- **Operators:** Independent nodes hosting models/agents/eval/data; rewarded for high-quality work and uptime.
- **Governance posture:** Community-guided. A token or on-chain layer may coordinate routing/rewards/governance later, but no supply/emission/contract details are committed here.

## Principles
- **Work > speculation:** Rewards should track delivered work and quality, not hype.
- **Progressive decentralization:** Start centralized/off-chain; add on-chain coordination once safe, legal, and battle-tested.
- **Data and user safety first:** Privacy and compliance stay central; only metadata and proofs belong on-chain (if/when used).
- **Optional crypto surface:** End users stay on simple SaaS billing; operators/governance can opt into on-chain rails later.

## Operator Value Model (Conceptual)
- Traffic allocation favors capable, reliable nodes; newcomers still get a growth lane.
- Rewards are tied to normalized work and quality/eval scores; exact formulas and any slashing rules will be defined with community input and legal review before activation.
- If a token is used, it is for coordination and governance; numbers, emissions, liquidity, and jurisdictions are intentionally omitted here.

## Data & Privacy Posture
- User and corpus data stay off-chain with strict access controls.
- On-chain (if used) would hold only metadata, hashes, receipts, or governance signals—never raw content.
- Evaluator/Compliance agents regularly test for policy and privacy adherence.

## Path to Decentralization (High-Level, Non-Binding)
1) **Off-chain now:** Centralized registry, routing, and payouts; accrue quality and usage data; keep UX simple.
2) **Multi-node alpha:** Trusted operators join; payouts can remain fiat/USDT; iterate on reputation and routing.
3) **Community-governed params (off-chain first):** Publish routing/reward/eval parameters; adopt community review before changes.
4) **Optional on-chain coordination (later):** Introduce minimal on-chain primitives (e.g., registry, receipts, governance hooks) only after legal/compliance review.
5) **Broader marketplace:** Open agent templates and specialized services; expand operator classes as quality and safety mature.

## Risk & Clarity Notes
- Nothing here is an offer, promise, or guarantee. Token, legal wrapper, and settlement details are deliberately unspecified and may change.
- Regulatory posture will be set with counsel before any on-chain or token launch; jurisdictions are not fixed in this doc.
- Complexity is hidden from end users; operators can opt into deeper protocol features as they mature.

## How to Contribute Now
- Run and improve the off-chain stack; measure and boost quality, latency, and reliability.
- Propose evals and routing heuristics; add observability to Helix for usage and pseudo-payouts.
- Help design safe, minimal on-chain hooks (if/when pursued) while keeping the default experience centralized and simple.
